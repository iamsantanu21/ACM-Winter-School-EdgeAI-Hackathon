To move to a real-world demo with a Hotspot, you need to ensure all devices (Laptop, Phone, Arduino) are on the same Wi-Fi network and know each other's IP addresses.


Receiver (Laptop):

IP: Needs to listen on 0.0.0.0 (which means "all Wi-Fi interfaces"). Your code already does this.
Port: Listens on 5007.
Action: I will add a helper to receiver.py to print your Laptop's IP address when it starts. You will need this IP for the Arduino code.
Important: Ensure your Windows Firewall allows Python to accept public/private connections, otherwise the Arduino packets will be blocked.


Sender (Arduino Nicla):

You must update your Arduino C++ sketch.
Send packets to Laptop IP on port 5007.
Send packets to Phone IP on port 5005.


Mock Sender (Testing Tool):

I will update mock_sender.py so you can use it to test the connection to the Phone App before the Arduino is ready. You will just need to enter your Phone's IP in the script.


Summary of Steps for Demo:

Connect all devices to the Hotspot.
Run receiver.py: Look at the terminal output for *** DEMO SETUP: Configure Arduino to send to Laptop IP: 192.168.x.x ***.
Find Phone IP: Go to Settings > About Phone > Status to find the Phone's IP (e.g., 192.168.x.y).
Configure Arduino:
udp.beginPacket("192.168.x.x", 5007); (Laptop)
udp.beginPacket("192.168.x.y", 5005); (Phone)
Test: If the Arduino isn't ready, edit mock_sender.py with the Phone's IP and run it to test the app and dashboard simultaneously.
